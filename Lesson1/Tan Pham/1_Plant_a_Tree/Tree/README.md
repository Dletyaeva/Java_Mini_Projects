## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

## REMINDER: To compile in VS Code manually
1. Navigate to src folder in terminal
  * right click on the src folder
  * click on the option `Open in Integrated Terminal`
2. run `javac fileName.java`
  * **replace** `fileName` with the java file you are trying to compile
  * if the compilation is successful you will find a fileName.class file in bin
3. run `java fileName`
  * **DO NOT** include the `.java` extension
