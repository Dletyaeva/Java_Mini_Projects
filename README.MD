# 👾 Lesson 2 – Classes, Constructors, and Objects

Welcome to Lesson 2! In this lesson, you’ll build on what you learned last week by creating and interacting with **your own Java classes**.

You'll be practicing:
- Constructors & the `this` keyword  
- Getter & setter methods  
- Method overloading  
- Object interaction & method calls  
- Simple terminal input using `Scanner`  

---

## 🧭 What to Do

Everything for this lesson is inside the `Lesson 2/` folder. Your task is to:

1. **Explore the demos** provided to help understand new concepts  
2. **Complete both challenges** inside the `Challenges/` folder  
3. **Work in your own folder** (named after you)  
4. **Commit and sync your work** when you're done

## 🧪 Your Tasks

### ✅ Challenge 1: Basic Calculator  
Create a calculator with two versions of each method:
- One using instance variables (set through constructor)
- One using method overloading (parameters)
Also includes user input + output handling.

### ✅ Challenge 2: Build-a-Droid  
Create your own `Droid` class that can:
- Perform tasks (reducing battery)
- Report its energy
- Transfer energy to another droid

> Read the code comments carefully — they walk you through each step.

## 🧠 Use the Demos

Before starting the challenges, check out the demos in:
- `Demo_1/` — Basic use of constructors and setter/getter methods  
- `OOP_Demos/` — More examples of how classes, objects, and interfaces work in Java  

Run them, read them, and use them as reference as you work.

## 🗂 How to Organize Your Work

Inside the `Challenges/` folder:

1. Create a folder named after you:
   ```
   Lesson 2/
   └─ Challenges/
      └─ yourName/
   ```

2. Inside your folder, copy the challenge folders:
   ```
   yourName/
   ├─ 1_Basic_Calculator/
   └─ 2_Build_Droid/
   ```

> Do **not** modify the original challenge folders.  
> Do all your work inside your own folder.

---

## 🔁 When You're Done

After completing both challenges:

1. Stage and commit your changes with a short message  
2. Sync your changes to GitHub  
3. Create a pull request and merge it (see Lesson 1’s README if you need a refresher)

## 🧃 Pro Tips

- Look closely at the demos before starting
- Test your code often — run it as you go
- Use print statements to debug!
- Don’t be afraid to ask questions
