   â”œâ”€ 3_Math_Magic/Magic
```
## Step 4: Complete the Mini-Projects
  1. Instructions on what to do next are in the code comments and README files for each mini-project

  4. After you complete each project `commit` the changes to your local repo by:

  1. When you've finished all three projects:
   * Open `Github Desktop`
   * Click on the blue button arrow then `Create Pull Request`

# ðŸ’¡Final Notes
* Ask if you're stuck! Github can be tricky at first.
* Be careful not to edit the original three folders - work inside your copy
