# Instructions
## Step 0: Clone this Repo
  1. In the Upper-Right corner click the green `<> Code` drop down button
  2. Click on `Open with Github Desktop`
  3. Save the Repo in folder that you will use for other coding projects
  4. Return to the github repo
## Step 1: Create Your Own Branch
In this repo (branch `main`): 
  1. Click on `Branch` in the top-left corner **or** click on `main` then `View All Branches`
  2. Click on green button `New Branch`

  2. On the top click on `Fetch Origin`
  3. Then click on `Current Branch`
  4. You should see your name on the list - click on it
  5. Then still in github desktop click on `Open in VS Code`
## Step 3: Create Your Project Folder
  1. Inside `Lesson1` folder create a **new folder with your first name** 
  2. **Copy** all 3 folders into your folder.
  * 1_Plant_a_Tree/Tree
  * 2_Mab_Libs/MadLibs
  * 3_Math_Magic/Magic <br>
**Here is what the folder structure should look like:**
```
Lesson1/
â”œâ”€ 1_Plant_a_Tree/Tree
â”œâ”€ 2_Mab_Libs/MadLibs
â”œâ”€ 3_Math_Magic/Magic
â”œâ”€ yourName/
   â”œâ”€ 1_Plant_a_Tree/Tree
   â”œâ”€ 2_Mab_Libs/MadLibs
   â”œâ”€ 3_Math_Magic/Magic
```
## Step 4: Complete the Mini-Projects
  1. Instructions on what to do next are in the code comments and README files for each mini-project
  2. Youâ€™ll be editing the code **inside your folder only.**
  3. MAKE SURE TO SAVE YOUR WORK BEFORE SUBMITTING!
  4. After you complete each project `commit` the changes to your local repo by:
   * Press `Ctrl + Shift + G`
   * Hover over the tab with the bold and all caps `CHANGES` and find three dots - hovering over those three dots should say `More Actions...` - **Click on the three dots**
   * Then click on **Changes** >> **Stage All Changes**

   * Then in the area where it says `Message` type `finished projectName`
   * Then Click on blue `Commit` button
   * Then Click on `Sync Changes`
   * Click `Ok` on the pop-up message

## Step 5: Submit Your Work / Merge Your Branch
  1. When you've finished all three projects:
   * Open `Github Desktop`
   * Click on `Create Pull Request`
   * Then click `View on Github` to open your repo in browser
   * On Github, click `Compare & Pull Request` button
   * On the next screen, click ``
   * If successful, click the purple `Delete branch` button

# ðŸ’¡Final Notes
* Ask if you're stuck! Github can be tricky at first.
* Be careful not to edit the original three folders - work inside your copy

# Quick Terms
* `Repo` = Short for repository, like a folder that holds your code projects.
* `Clone` = Make a copy of the repo on your computer.
* `Branch` = A separate version of the code you can work on without changing the original.
* `Commit` = Save your changes to GitHub.
* `Merge` = Combine your work back into the main project.
